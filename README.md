Scene text recognition is an essential task in computer
 vision with wide-ranging applications, from autonomous
 driving and augmented reality to digitizing documents
 and assisting visually impaired individuals.This project ex
plores a deep learning-based solution for scene text recog
nition using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network
 (CRNN) architecture [1]. The hybrid model integrates
 CNNsfor spatial feature extraction with Bidirectional Long
 Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for sequence
 modeling, and employs a lexicon-free transcription layer
 to handle diverse OCR tasks. Using synthetic datasets
 for training and benchmark datasets (IIIT5K) for testing,
 our model demonstrates robust text recognition capabilities
 across varied real-world scenarios. The report highlights
 dataset preprocessing techniques, model architecture, train
ing procedures, and performance benchmarks,
